Easy Steemit Delegation Script HTML and JS
This script lets you easily add a delegation form to your website. Not sure how all of this works but this is a super simple script that many folks need to help them integrate with steemconnect2.0. You can customize it how ever you want.

You will want to change the line 6 ... delagatee=steemthat to delegatee=yourusername. Of course you might want to change the image link also to make it yours. This script lets people delegate 10 Steem Power. I'll be adding a selection list to this soon unless someone else wants to add it before I get to it.
